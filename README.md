## Initial Setup

This is a project powered by .NET 7, to run correctly the App you need to do the following steps:

1. You need to check if you have .NET 7 on your machine. To do that you can execute **dotnet help**. Install if you donÂ´t have it.
3. Open a git bash (or terminal) into a custom folder and clone the repository inside them.
4. after that, go inside the root folder of the project (called PsicoAppAPI) and run **dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite --version 7.0.5**
5. In the same folder, then execute **dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design --version 7.0.5**
6. Finally, you can start the project with the command **dotnet run**, the default port is 5000 and you can see some API behaviour on http:localhost:5000/SwaggerUI
